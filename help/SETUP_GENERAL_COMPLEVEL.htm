        Compression Level

    <p>
        If you have set your compression method to not use compression, this setting will have no effect. This setting shouldn't have much of an effect when playing Fortnite. The general rule of thumb is: the slower your level, the more CPU it will take to update (which can cause updates to be slower), but your install size will be smaller.
