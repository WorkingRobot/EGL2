        This is approximately how many "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#Multithreading" target="_blank">threads</a>" are run in parallel when updating, verifying, etc. If you are updating and this value is too high, this can seriously impact performance due to too many concurrent downloads. But if this value is too low, you may not be using your internet or computer resources to its fullest extent.
