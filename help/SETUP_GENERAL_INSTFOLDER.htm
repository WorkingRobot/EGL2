    <p>
        This installation folder is where EGL2 will store all its files for Fortnite. <b>This is not where you set the folder of your previous (official Epic Games Launcher) installation.</b> EGL2 uses a completely separate storage mechanism for Fortnite which is incompatible and way different from your normal way of saving files. Make sure EGL2 is able to read and write in this folder and that this folder is empty (or previously used by EGL2).
